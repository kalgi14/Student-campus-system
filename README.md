The main project is located in web folder.

Other folders are for backup.

We used phpMyAdmin for our project, so basically you need to have it installed for the project.
We used xampp to install the phpMyAdmin.

Please add the database before running the program.
You need to create a database name SE452, then import our database file (located in the root of this repository) to the new database you have created.
